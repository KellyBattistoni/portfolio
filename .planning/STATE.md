# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-09)

**Core value:** A visitor leaves thinking: "This person doesn't just execute tasks — she sees the full system, adapts faster than anyone, and always thinks ahead on the business."
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — i18n Backbone

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 8 (i18n Backbone) — In progress
Plan: 2 of 3 in Phase 2 — Complete ✓
Status: Plan 02-02 complete (LanguageSwitcher + hook + App wiring shipped) — ready for Plan 02-03
Last activity: 2026-06-10 — Plan 02-02 executed and self-checked

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 21% (5 of ~24 expected plans)

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Plans |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Scaffold + Safety Rails | Complete ✓ | 3/3 |
| 2 | i18n Backbone | In progress | 2/3 |
| 3 | Scroll Infrastructure | Pending | TBD |
| 4 | Visual Foundations — Plasma + Noise | Pending | TBD |
| 5 | Hero + PillNav — First Vertical Slice | Pending | TBD |
| 6 | Content Sections | Pending | TBD |
| 7 | Polish & Performance | Pending | TBD |
| 8 | Deployment | Pending | TBD |

## Active Work

Phase 2 in progress. Plans 02-01 and 02-02 complete. Next: Plan 02-03 (verification + browser sanity checkpoint) per `.planning/phases/02-i18n-backbone/02-03-PLAN.md`.

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: ~16 min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- React + Vite over Next.js (no SSR needed; simpler GH Pages deploy)
- Plasma only on hero, unmount on scroll past (not opacity fade) to stop rAF loop
- PillNav hidden during hero, appears on scroll
- EN/ES wired before any section component (no retrofit)
- Root GitHub Pages repo `KellyBattistoni.github.io` (no `/portfolio` subpath)
- [01-01] `ignoreDeprecations: "6.0"` in tsconfig.app.json — silences TS 6.0 deprecation of `baseUrl` while keeping `@/*` paths working
- [01-01] `jiti` devDep installed — required by ESLint v10 to load `eslint.config.ts`
- [01-01] ESLint config in TypeScript (`eslint.config.ts`) not JavaScript — required removing scaffold's `eslint.config.js`
- [01-02] SVG `feTurbulence` data URI used for noise texture — no binary PNG asset, deterministic, commits cleanly
- [01-02] `react-error-boundary` v6 types `error` as `unknown` — `instanceof Error` guard required in both `FallbackProps` and `onError` callback
- [01-02] `AnimationFallback` renders brand-gradient div only — no visible text, indistinguishable from Plasma placeholder
- [01-03] `useState(getInitialCapabilities)` lazy initializer — synchronous first render, no flash of wrong state
- [01-03] `isLowEnd` and `supportsWebGL2` sampled once on mount only — hardware doesn't change at runtime
- [02-01] i18next bundled static JSON resources (no http-backend, no `<I18nextProvider>`) — single config module at `@/lib/i18n`
- [02-01] localStorage key locked as `kbv-lang` — brand-scoped, no collision
- [02-01] `caches: ['localStorage']` paired with `lookupLocalStorage` — without the pair the key is read but never written
- [02-01] `nonExplicitSupportedLngs: true` — `es-AR`/`es-MX`/`es-419` all resolve to `es`
- [02-01] `parseMissingKeyHandler` returns `'ns:key'` — missing keys render as visible path in dev
- [02-01] CustomTypeOptions augments `'i18next'` (NOT `'react-i18next'`) — `t()` lives on i18next core
- [02-01] `as const` mandatory on both `resources` and `defaultNS` — without it typed `t()` collapses to `(key: string) => string`
- [02-01] `useSuspense: false` — resources are sync-bundled, no Suspense boundary needed
- [02-01] `meta.title`/`meta.description` shipped as empty strings — keys defined now, copy in Phase 7
- [02-01] About/projects/stack/contact namespaces ship `_placeholder` stub — keeps namespace registered + ts-augmented until Phase 3 fills
- [02-02] Hook uses useTranslation() not direct import of @/lib/i18n — keeps hook composable and React-context-aware
- [02-02] LanguageSwitcher reads i18n.resolvedLanguage in active comparison + handleChange guard — never raw i18n.language
- [02-02] handleChange short-circuits if lng === current — avoids redundant changeLanguage calls / re-renders
- [02-02] Switcher hard-codes fixed top-right positioning — Phase 5 strips classes when moving into PillNav (no className prop now)
- [02-02] Accent color #FF4500 inline (after:bg-[#FF4500]) — explicit per CONTEXT.md, not yet hooked to CSS variable token
- [02-02] LanguageSwitcher wrapped in its OWN AnimationErrorBoundary in App.tsx — isolated crash domain from animation root
- [02-02] Demo hero uses inline styles intentionally — throwaway code, Phase 5 replaces the whole <main> with the real Hero component

### Resolved Blockers

- TypeScript chosen (TS, not JSX-only) — confirmed via scaffold choice in 01-01
- Both CV PDFs confirmed present in repo root — will copy to `public/` in Phase 6

### Remaining Open Questions

- framer-motion vs motion package name (verify at install in Phase 3)
- Number of NDA-safe case studies ready (target 3–4 deep) — needed before Phase 6
- Primary CTA framing: clients vs jobs — needed before Phase 5
- Plasma GLSL shader source — port from inspo or author fresh — needed before Phase 4

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-10
Stopped at: Plan 02-02 complete — LanguageSwitcher (EN/ES underline tabs) + useLocalizeDocumentAttributes hook + App.tsx wiring shipped. Build (252.92 kB / 80.27 kB gzip), typecheck, and lint all clean.
Resume: continue Phase 2 with Plan 02-03 (`.planning/phases/02-i18n-backbone/02-03-PLAN.md`) — verification + browser sanity checkpoint.
